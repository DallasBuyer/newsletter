# New year translations
Last year in december @maxogden [tried to get NodeSchoolers to work on translation](https://github.com/nodeschool/organizers/issues/64).
And we do have significant process on this front. [Workshopper](https://github.com/rvagg/workshopper), the base for a lot of content related to nodeschool, has been already translated into 
translated to Spanish, Portugese, French, Russian, Chinese, Taiwanese and Japanese. Yet there is still much work to be done. Particularly 
[the translation of Adventure](https://github.com/substack/adventure/pull/7) is still in somewhat of a rough state. Most importantly its not compatible
to how workshopper works. If you have some hands to spare: Just start hacking on it yourself and/or exchange yourself with other volunteers using [github](https://github.com/nodeschool/organizers/issues) or [Gitter](https://gitter.im/nodeschool/organizers)
